# Species-Segmentation-with-Cluster-Analysis
The Iris flower dataset is one of the most popular ones for machine learning. You can read a lot about it online and have probably already heard of it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set

We didn't want to use it in the lectures, but believe that it would be very interesting for you to try it out (and maybe read about it on your own).

There are 4 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
We going to clusters Iris flower species by features

In conclusion,if you read about it, the original dataset has 3 sub-species of the Iris flower. Therefore, the number of clusters is 3
